# The beginnings

Today marks the debut of The Pearl, my new blog. This blog is a home for my tech ramblings, complaints, and the occasional tutorial. If you couldn't guess, the name comes tapioca pearls, the foundation of bubble tea (boba).

# Newsletter

In the near future, I will be starting my newsletter. It will also be called The Pearl in order to confuse everyone (including myself). 
If you're interested, come back to the site at a later time and I will have an announcement.

# How to support my work

At the moment, there is no way for you to support my work. The best you can do is take a look at my projects and give me feedback so that I can make them better.
Positive or negative, it's all valuable.
